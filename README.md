The strongest hero.  
The strongest sword.  
The strongest power.  

Defend your beloved village from the onslaught of the undead by using your enormous power wisely to avoid becoming a villain!  

With great power... is a 2 days long game jam project (Kenney jam 2025) developed in Unreal Engine by a team of 8 people (5 game designer and 3 programmers).  

It was my first 2 days game jam during which I worked on the main character using the Unreal's ***gameplay ability system (GAS)*** for the behaviour's logic, along with the controls and the animations.
